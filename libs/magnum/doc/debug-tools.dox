/** @page debug-tools Debugging helpers
@brief Convenience classes to help you during development.

-   Previous page: @ref shapes

@ref DebugTools library provides various helper classes to help you with
prototyping and debugging applications without the need to write too much
common code. They probably have no usage in production code, but can be useful
in development. See documentation of @ref DebugTools namespace for more
information about building and usage with CMake.

@section debug-tools-renderers Debug renderers

Debug renderers provide a way to visualize objects and object features in
@ref scenegraph "scene graph" without the need to mess around with meshes and
shaders. They are implemented as object features, so you can attach any number
of them to any object.

Basic usage involves instancing @ref DebugTools::ResourceManager and keeping it
for the whole lifetime of debug renderers. Next you need some
@ref SceneGraph::DrawableGroup instance. You can use the same group as for the
rest of your scene, but preferrably use dedicated one for debug renderers, so
you can easily enable or disable debug rendering.

Next step is to create configuration for your debug renderers and create
particular debug renderer. The configuration is managed using the resource
manager - you create configuration instance, add it to the manager and then
reference it using particular resource key. This way you can easily share the
same options with more renderers. If no options are specified or resource with
given key doesn't exist, default fallback is used.

Example usage: visualizing object position, rotation and scaling using
@link DebugTools::ObjectRenderer @endlink:
@code
// Global instance of debug resource manager, drawable group for the renderers
DebugTools::ResourceManager manager;
SceneGraph::DrawableGroup3D debugDrawables;

// Create renderer options which will be referenced later by "my" resource key
DebugTools::ResourceManager::instance().set("my",
    DebugTools::ObjectRendererOptions().setSize(0.3f));

// Create debug renderer for given object, use "my" options for it. The
// renderer is automatically added to the object features and also to
// specified drawable group.
Object3D* object;
new DebugTools::ObjectRenderer2D(*object, "my", debugDrawables);
@endcode

See @ref DebugTools::ObjectRenderer and @ref DebugTools::ShapeRenderer for more
information.
