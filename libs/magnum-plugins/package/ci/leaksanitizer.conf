# Configuration file for LeakSanitizer run on the Travis CI

# Qt4 leaks stuff from some internal QString functions (8 allocations, 476
# bytes every time)
leak:libQtCore.so

# Using JpegImporter from AnyImageImporter leaks. Using JpegImporter directly
# with the same file doesn't. Not reproducible on my machine, so I blame Travis
# and its ancient packages (1 allocation, 4096 bytes)
leak:AnyImageImporterTest

# Direct leak of 7280 byte(s) in 1 object(s). Happens only on old Assimp from
# Travis CI, not reproducible on my machine
